# Login-Page
This is a simple Login Page utilizing JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL. 

It's a fairly basic "first project" login page allows users to manually register on the website and store that users information in a MySQL Database which than utilizes POST and GET methods with the help of PHP to retrieve a users Username and Password allowing them to login to the website.

If users do not want to register manually the login-page does utilize Facebook and Google authenticaiton to sign the user into the website.
